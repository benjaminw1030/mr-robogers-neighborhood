      <p>It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood,</p>
      <p>A beautiful day for a neighbor,</p>
      <p>Would you be mine?</p>
      <p>Could you be mine?</p>
      <br>
      <p>It's a neighborly day in this beautywood</p>
      <p>A neighborly day for a beauty,</p>
      <p>Would you be mine?</p>
      <p>Could you be mine?</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you,</p>
      <p>I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So let's make the most of this beautiful day,</p>
      <p>Since we're together, we might as well say,</p>
      <p>Would you be mine?</p>
      <p>Could you be mine?</p>
      <p>Won't you be my neighbor?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Won't you please,</p>
      <p>Won't you please,</p>
      <p>Please won't you be my neighbor?</p>
